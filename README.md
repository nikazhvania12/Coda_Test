coda test

Creating and finishing this project took me about a 10 hours, Most of it was configuring my azure application and realiing that i could use the graph client for requests.
Once you start the project, you will find all 4 requests avaliable on swagger.I did not create a database, to store my credentials, because they are stored 
in application.json. As long as you change the credentials, the code works with any microsoft account with an azure application.
